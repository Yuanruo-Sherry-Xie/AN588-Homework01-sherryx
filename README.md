# AN588-Homework01-sherryx

-   Hi there! üòÑ

-   In this repo you should see the following:

    -   Unprettified orignial code (r markdown)

    -   Unprettified orignial code (html)

    -   Prettified code based off of the original code \^ (r markdown)

    -   Prettified code based off of the original code \^ (html)

    -   Peer commentary from Christian Mei (r markdown)

    -   Peer commentary from Christian Mei (html)

-   My unprettified code which incorporates notes from modules 3 and 4, as well as all the challenges from module 4

-   Each section should be the title/ header before the notes and code are shown

-   I have comments in my code sections to help my readers and myself understand what's going on or my thought process in general, let me know if they are confusing

-   In my original code is also 5 struggles I encountered while doing homework 1

Thank you for reading this!üëç

### 5 Struggles I Have Encountered Doing HW 1

1.  **Setting up GitHub and External Tools**

    1.  Having taken AN 595, I initially assumed that R Markdown, Quarto, and knitting to an HTML file were the only necessary steps for exporting work, and that everything could be done within R. However, this assignment required me to download and integrate tools like Git, a text editor (Pulsar), and GitHub, which opened my eyes to the vast ecosystem of programming tools available beyond RStudio.

2.  **Deleting Files from GitHub and Losing Sync with Local R Files**

    1.  In an attempt to follow the instructions that specified having only six files in the GitHub repository, I hastily deleted extra files, thinking they were unnecessary. Unfortunately, I later realized that deleting the R project file severed the connection between GitHub and my local R project, preventing me from pushing changes. This was a tough lesson in version control, and I‚Äôve learned to be more cautious before deleting any files.

3.  **Merge Conflicts When Pushing a Peer Commentary File**

    1.  I encountered a merge conflict when I tried to push my updated R Markdown file after making local edits without first pulling the latest version from GitHub. Because the local and remote files had different versions, GitHub couldn‚Äôt merge them automatically. I eventually resolved this issue by deleting my local repository and cloning the updated version from GitHub. Although this allowed me to make changes and successfully knit my document, it also meant that the final push showed me as the editor instead of my peer, Christian.

4.  **Providing Peer Commentary on Code Quality**

    1.  My previous experience in AN 595 primarily involved working with pre-written and well-structured R Markdown files, so I wasn‚Äôt accustomed to reviewing others' code. When I compared my own messy code to my group members' well-organized work, I initially felt discouraged about my coding skills. Additionally, I struggled with giving meaningful feedback beyond organization tips. However, my supportive and encouraging teammates helped me see that feedback, even on organization, is valuable, and I gained confidence in providing constructive suggestions.

5.  **Struggling with Challenge 4: Structuring the Primate Taxonomy List**

    1.  The most time-consuming challenge for me was Challenge 4, where I had to recreate the hierarchical bullet-point list of primates. Initially, I attempted to structure the list from the top down, listing everything inside a `list()` function, but my code became disorganized. Christian suggested starting from the smallest classification and building upward, which made it much easier to rearrange my code while maintaining clarity. This experience taught me the importance of writing clear, well-labeled code to help others understand and reproduce my work.
